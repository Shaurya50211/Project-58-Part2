		<p>I like to read the books of Roald Dahl. I like to read his books because he writes his books with new words. For e.g he invented brand new words in the book called BFG. It was a total hit! The books I read that were written by him are The Witches, BFG and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Whats your favourite author? I also like the author Dav Pilkey. Dav Pilkey's books are really funny! I am exploring many other authors that I'll share with you some time later. For now, bye!</p>
